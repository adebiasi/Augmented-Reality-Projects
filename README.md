# Augmented-Reality-Projects (my master degree thesis).

## Introduction
The aims of this project are the following: 

On the one hand, develop an IPhone application in order to convey information coming from different sources and merge them into a web service. 

On the other hand, interpret geo-referenced data in order to provide an augmented reality interface; the virtual content are overlay with the reality (represented by the vision of the camera). 

The user can see nearest restaurants and the shortest way to reach them. The geo-referenced data about the routing are provided by Googlemaps, and the restaurants information are obtained by different on line catalogs and stored into a database.
